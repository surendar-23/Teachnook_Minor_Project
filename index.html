                The Red Fort is a historic fort in the city of Delhi in India
                that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors.
                Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on
                12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to
                Delhi. Originally red and white, its painting is credited to
                architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj
                Mahal.

                <br /><br />
                <strong>Interesting fact: </strong>In 1739, the fort’s artwork
                and jewels were plundered when Nadir Shah invaded the Mughal
                Empire. The fort was built by Shah Jahān in the mid-17th century
                and remains a major tourist attraction. The fort was designated
                a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007.
